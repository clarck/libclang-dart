/**
 * A cursor representing some element in the abstract syntax tree for
 * a translation unit.
 *
 * The cursor abstraction unifies the different kinds of entities in a
 * program--declaration, statements, expressions, references to declarations,
 * etc.--under a single "cursor" abstraction with a common set of operations.
 * Common operation for a cursor include: getting the physical location in
 * a source file where the cursor points, getting the name associated with a
 * cursor, and retrieving cursors for any child nodes of a particular cursor.
 *
 * Cursors can be produced in two specific ways.
 * clang_getTranslationUnitCursor() produces a cursor for a translation unit,
 * from which one can use clang_visitChildren() to explore the rest of the
 * translation unit. clang_getCursor() maps from a physical source location
 * to the entity that resides at that location, allowing one to map from the
 * source code into the AST.
